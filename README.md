# Quick-sort-Logo-style
A funny toy beginners can learn to build

A lot of people love the Quick-sort: because it's funny.
Seymour Papert and Brian Harvey wrote fun books about the Logo dialect of List Processing.
The Logo dialect uses language in a way similar to natural English.
The selector first-item selects the first item of a list.
The selector without-first item returns the list without its first item.
The constructor add-to-front adds an item to the front of a list.
The constructor add-to-end adds an item to the end of a list.
The constructor combine-lists combines two lists into one list.
The constructor listify takes any number of items and makes them into a list.
The question empty? asks if a list is empty.
The question same? asks if an item is the same as another item.
The question less-than? asks if a number is less than another number.
The word yes represents the answer yes.
The word no represents the answer no.
The word the-empty-list represents the empty list.

Our programs use four magic words:
Define creates a program and allows us to name it.
Lambda creates inputs and allows us to name them.
Let creates local variables and allows us to name them.
Letrec creates helper programs and allows us to name them.
