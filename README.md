# Quick-sort-Logo-style
A funny toy beginners can learn to build

A lot of people love the Quick-sort: because it's funny.
Seymour Papert and Brian Harvey wrote fun books about the Logo dialect of List Processing.
The Logo dialect uses language in a way similar to natural English.
The selector first-item selects the first item of a list.
The selector without-first item returns the list without its first item.
The constructor add-to-front adds an item to the front of a list.
The constructor add-to-end adds an item to the end of a list.
The constructor combine-lists combines two lists into one list.
The constructor listify takes any number of items and makes them into a list.
The question empty? asks if a list is empty.
The question same? asks if an item is the same as another item.
The question less-than? asks if a number is less than another number.
The word yes represents the answer yes.
The word no represents the answer no.
The word the-empty-list represents the empty list.

Logo dialect has four magic words:
Define is a function that allows us to create a program and name it.
Lambda is a function that allows us to create inputs and name them.
Let is a function that allows us to create local variables and name them.
Letrec is a function that allows us to create helper programs and name them.
